# MPFI-Neuroimaging-Workshop
Thanks for joining our 2018 MPFI Neuroimaging Workshop this year! This code repository contains:
<br />**1.)** A guide to setup ImageJ, and allow this program to interface with MATLAB. I have included a guide for setting up ImageJ for Windows and OSX users. 
<br />**2.)** MATLAB code to allow you to fully process raw two-photon calcium imaging data from start to finish. The code will allow you to:
<br /> - read in multi-page TIFF stacks into MATLAB.
<br /> - use image registration to eliminate motion artifacts in an entire imaging stack. The included image registration algorithms are based on either Manuel Guizar's efficient subpixel image registration by cross-correlation (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/18401-efficient-subpixel-image-registration-by-cross-correlation) or Theo Walker's faster image registration with cross-correlation (https://github.com/naroom/downsampleReg).
<br /> - segment out cellular ROIs in a semi-automated way with the Cell Magic Wand tool written by Theo Walker
<br /> - extract out fluorescence timecourses for both our cells and the surrounding neuropil.
<br /> - convert raw fluorescence timecourses to Î”F/Fo. Fo is accurately computed by via a moving percentile-filter.
<br /> - basic analysis code that will allow you to inspect the individual response traces of every cell, the impact of neuropil contamination on cellular responses, the tuning of each cells for a stimulus (here the stimulus orientation of our gratings), and distant-dependent noise correlations.
